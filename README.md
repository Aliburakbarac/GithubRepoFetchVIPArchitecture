GitHub API VIP Architecture

This project is an example of using VIP (View-Interactor-Presenter) and Clean Architecture principles in an iOS application with GitHub's API. The application lists a specified GitHub user's public repositories and allows opening them in Safari. The project also demonstrates the use of Swift's "actor" to manage concurrency and state.
